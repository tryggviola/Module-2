#  HTML & CSS - Introduction // Project 2

## Project brief 

Create a simple site with a layout and display elements in certain position. 

## The Goal 
<ul>
<li>Understand how to layout a website</li>
<li>Understand the fundimentals of the Box Model</li>
</uk>

## Intro

I wanted to make a simple poster showing different types of layouting mathods and combining them all together. 

## The Process

I wanted to do something that would have different size of boxes and with different things inside them so I made a layout in <strong>Figma</strong>. Once I was happy with it I started putting every component of it into HTML and finally finished everything in CSS.


## Conclusion 

This exercise was really good but at the same time really hard but I learned alot. The hardest part was mixing flexbox with grid and I also experimented with what would happen at different widths so please try to resize the poster and see what happens :)
